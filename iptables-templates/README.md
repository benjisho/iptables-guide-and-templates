- [**directory-traversal-protection.rules.v4**](cyber-attacks-protection/directory-traversal-protection.rules.v4): Guard your web applications against directory traversal attacks by dropping requests that contain malicious characters or patterns in the URL path.
- [**dns-amplification.rules.v4**](cyber-attacks-protection/dns-amplification.rules.v4): Shield your DNS server from being used for DNS amplification attacks. This template limits the rate of DNS queries per source IP address and drops requests that have a large response size.
- [**file-inclusion-attacks.rules.v4**](cyber-attacks-protection/file-inclusion-attacks.rules.v4): Defend against file inclusion attacks on your web applications by dropping requests that contain malicious characters or patterns in the URL query string.
- [**hpkp.rules.v4**](cyber-attacks-protection/hpkp.rules.v4): Implement HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) for enhanced web server security. This template adds a custom header that specifies the hashes of your SSL/TLS certificates.
- [**ip-reputation-lists.rules.v4**](cyber-attacks-protection/ip-reputation-lists.rules.v4): Block incoming traffic from known malicious IP addresses using IP reputation lists, which are databases of IP addresses that have been reported as sources of spam, malware, phishing, or other malicious activities.
- [**malware-download-prevention.rules.v4**](cyber-attacks-protection/malware-download-prevention.rules.v4): Prevent malware download attempts on your server by blocking requests that contain known malware signatures, suspicious file extensions, obfuscated or encoded payloads, abnormal HTTP response codes, and more.
- [**network-anomaly-detection.rules.v4**](cyber-attacks-protection/network-anomaly-detection.rules.v4): Detect and log network anomalies on your server, including port scanning, SYN flooding, ICMP flooding, and other unusual activity.

You can find these templates in the `iptables-templates` directory of this repository. Each template comes with a brief description and explanations of the rules.

## How to Use

To use these templates, follow these steps:

Make sure you have iptables installed and configured on your server. Refer to the installation and configuration guide if needed.

Ensure you have root privileges or sudo access to run iptables commands.

- To apply a template, use the `iptables-restore` command. For example, to apply the `block-malicious-user-agents.rules.v4` template, run:
   ```bash
   sudo iptables-restore < templates/block-malicious-user-agents.rules.v4
   ```

- To append a template's rules to your existing configuration, use the -n option:
   ```bash
    sudo iptables-restore -n < templates/block-malicious-user-agents.rules.v4
    ```

- To insert a template's rules at a specific position in your existing chains, use the `iptables` command with the `-I` option:
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -I INPUT 5 <rule>
   ```

- To remove a template, flush the appropriate chain using the `iptables -F` command. For example, to clear the `INPUT` chain, run:
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -F INPUT
   ```

- To save a template, use the iptables-save command. For example, to save the block-malicious-user-agents.rules.v4 template, run:
   ```bash
   sudo iptables-save > templates/block-malicious-user-agents.rules.v4
   ```
